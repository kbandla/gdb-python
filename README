Scriping GDB using Python

From GDB>=7.0, you can script gdb using python in a stable way. 
Here, you will find notes on gdb-python.

Linux:
I have tried this on Linux and it works fine. 
You can find the compiled binary in bin/linux

OS X:
It did compile on OS X, but I'm not yet sure how well it works on ObjC files.
You can find the compiled gdb binary in bin/osx 
Apple has their own fork, but that does not have python support.

You can download gdb from : http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gdb/

Installing:
You will need to configure gdb with python support:
./configure --with-python=/usr/local
make && make install
