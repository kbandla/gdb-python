Scriping GDB using Python

With GDB 7.2, you can script gdb using python in a stable way. 
Here, you will find notes on gdb-python.

Linux:
I have tried this on Linux and it works fine. 

OS X:
It did compile on OS X, but I'm not sure how well vanilla gdb works on OS X.
Apple has their own fork, but that does not have python support.

Download gdb-7.2 from here: http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gdb/

Installing:
You will need to configure gdb with python support:
./configure --with-python=/usr/local
make && make install
